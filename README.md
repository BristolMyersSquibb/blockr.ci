# blockr.ci

[![ci](https://github.com/cynkra/blockr.ci/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cynkra/blockr.ci/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

Reusable GitHub Actions CI workflows for the [blockr](https://bristolmyerssquibb.github.io/blockr-site/) ecosystem.

## Usage

Consumer repo `.github/workflows/`:

### `ci.yaml` — PR + merge-queue gate

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
  merge_group:

jobs:
  ci:
    uses: cynkra/blockr.ci/.github/workflows/ci.yaml@main
    secrets:
      CODECOV_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
      BLOCKR_PAT: ${{ secrets.BLOCKR_PAT }}
```

Leave the `pull_request:` trigger unfiltered. Adding `branches: main`
silently disables CI for stacked PRs (PRs whose base is another feature
branch) — they get no lint, no smoke, no signal at all until the base
is retargeted to `main`.

### `pkgdown.yaml` — site deploy on merge to main

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: main

name: pkgdown

jobs:
  pkgdown:
    uses: cynkra/blockr.ci/.github/workflows/pkgdown.yaml@main
    secrets:
      BLOCKR_PAT: ${{ secrets.BLOCKR_PAT }}
    permissions:
      contents: write
```

PR-side pkgdown sanity checks live in `ci.yaml`'s `pkgdown-dev` job;
`pkgdown.yaml` only deploys. Consumers without a deployed site (e.g.
packages with Quarto-based docs) simply omit this workflow file.

### `revdep.yaml` — reverse-dependency checks (optional)

Add a second `jobs:` entry alongside the `ci` entry, gated on
`merge_group`:

```yaml
jobs:
  ci:
    uses: cynkra/blockr.ci/.github/workflows/ci.yaml@main
    secrets:
      CODECOV_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
      BLOCKR_PAT: ${{ secrets.BLOCKR_PAT }}
  revdep:
    if: github.event_name == 'merge_group'
    uses: cynkra/blockr.ci/.github/workflows/revdep.yaml@main
    with:
      revdep-packages: |
        BristolMyersSquibb/blockr.dock
    secrets:
      BLOCKR_PAT: ${{ secrets.BLOCKR_PAT }}
```

Pass secrets by name. `secrets: inherit` does not forward secrets
across organisations — the inherited values silently arrive blank in
the called job.

## Pipeline

| Trigger | Jobs |
|---|---|
| `pull_request` | `lint`, `smoke`, `pkgdown-dev`, `coverage` (parallel) |
| `merge_group` | `check` matrix → `check-all`; `revdep` matrix → `revdep-all` (if configured) |
| `push: main` | `pkgdown.yaml` deploy (if configured) |

PR jobs run in parallel for fast feedback. The expensive multi-platform
`check` matrix and reverse-dependency checks are reserved for the merge
queue — they gate the merge but never block PR iteration.

`check-all` and `revdep-all` aggregate their respective matrices into a
single stable name, so adding/removing a platform or revdep package
doesn't churn the required-checks list.

### Merge queue

Without GitHub's merge queue enabled, `merge_group` events never fire
and the multi-platform `check` matrix never runs — a green PR can then
produce a red `main` when one of the matrix platforms fails. Enabling
the merge queue closes that gap: the queue runs the full pipeline
against the would-be merge commit and blocks the merge on failure.

To enable, in the consumer repo's branch protection settings for `main`:

1. **Require a pull request before merging**.
2. **Require status checks to pass** — list these stable names:
   - `ci / lint`
   - `ci / smoke`
   - `ci / pkgdown-dev`
   - `ci / coverage`
   - `ci / check-all`
   - `revdep / revdep-all` (if `revdep.yaml` is configured)

   Skipped jobs satisfy required checks, so the queue accepts the
   PR-only jobs as `skipped` on `merge_group` refs (and vice versa for
   `check-all` / `revdep-all` on PR refs).
3. **Require merge queue** — leave the merge method as **merge commit**
   (squash and rebase strip the merge metadata downstream branches use
   to stay aligned).

Stacked PRs (PRs whose base is not `main`) still merge as plain pushes
to the parent feature branch and bypass the queue — that is intentional;
the queue is reserved for `main`.

## Inputs

### `ci.yaml`

| Input | Type | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lintr-exclusions` | newline-separated list | `''` | File paths to exclude from linting |
| `coverage-threshold` | number | `0` | Minimum coverage percent for the `coverage` job to pass. `0` disables the gate; coverage is still uploaded to Codecov. |
| `skip-pkgdown` | boolean | `false` | DEPRECATED — pkgdown moved to `pkgdown.yaml`. No-op. |
| `revdep-packages` | newline-separated list | `''` | DEPRECATED — moved to `revdep.yaml`. No-op. |

### `revdep.yaml`

| Input | Type | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `revdep-packages` | newline-separated list | _(required)_ | Downstream packages to reverse-dep check. |

### `pkgdown.yaml`

No inputs.

### Example with inputs

```yaml
jobs:
  ci:
    uses: cynkra/blockr.ci/.github/workflows/ci.yaml@main
    with:
      coverage-threshold: 80
      lintr-exclusions: |
        vignettes/foo.qmd
        vignettes/bar.qmd
    secrets:
      CODECOV_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
      BLOCKR_PAT: ${{ secrets.BLOCKR_PAT }}
```

## What's included

- **Lint** with a canonical lintr config (`object_name_linter = NULL`) — PR gate
- **Smoke test** — single-platform R CMD check — PR gate
- **pkgdown-dev** — `pkgdown::build_site(devel = TRUE)`, artifact upload, no deploy — PR gate
- **Coverage** via `covr::package_coverage()` + codecov, optional threshold — PR gate
- **Full check** — 4-platform matrix (macOS, Windows, Ubuntu devel, Ubuntu oldrel) — merge-queue gate
- **Reverse-dependency checks** against configurable downstream packages — merge-queue gate
- **pkgdown deploy** — site build + deploy to `gh-pages` on push to `main`
- **parse-deps** — pin a downstream revdep ref via a `` ```deps `` block in the PR body, read fresh when the merge queue runs revdep

## Dependency resolution

Non-CRAN dependencies (e.g. other blockr.\* packages, or anything that lives only on GitHub) are declared the standard R way: a `Remotes:` field in `DESCRIPTION`.

```
Package: blockr.dock
Imports:
    blockr.core,
    g6R
Remotes:
    BristolMyersSquibb/blockr.core,
    cynkra/g6R
```

`r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies` reads `Remotes:` directly, and so does `pak::local_install()` on a contributor's laptop — CI behavior is exactly what you get locally, no central registry, no implicit overrides.

### Per-PR revdep refs

The deps block in a PR body controls which ref of each revdep gets checked out for the **revdep job** — nothing else. It is not a mechanism for overriding forward dependencies; those belong in `Remotes:` in `DESCRIPTION`.

````markdown
```deps
BristolMyersSquibb/blockr.dag#111
BristolMyersSquibb/blockr.ai@my-feature-branch
```
````

Each line is `owner/repo@branch` or `owner/repo#PR-number`. The matching revdep job checks out that ref instead of the default branch.

`parse-deps` validates each entry against the package's `DESCRIPTION`: if a deps-block entry's package name appears in `Imports`/`Depends`/`LinkingTo`/`Suggests`/`Remotes`, parse-deps fails with a pointer to `Remotes:`. This catches the common mistake of trying to use the deps block to swap in a dev branch of a forward dep.

The revdep job runs only in the merge queue, and it reads the deps block fresh from the PR body each time the queue runs. To change which ref gets checked out, edit the block and re-enqueue — there is no separate re-run trigger.

### Example

You're working on `blockr.dock` and need the revdep job to test against an in-progress PR on `blockr.dag`:

1. Open your PR on `blockr.dock`. The configured `revdep-packages` input includes `BristolMyersSquibb/blockr.dag`, so the revdep job runs against `blockr.dag`'s default branch by default.
2. To pin it to a specific PR, add to the PR body:

   ````markdown
   ```deps
   BristolMyersSquibb/blockr.dag#111
   ```
   ````

3. When the PR is enqueued, the merge-queue revdep job reads the block and checks out `blockr.dag` PR #111 head instead of the default branch.
4. To point at a different PR later, edit the block and re-enqueue.

To override a forward dep (e.g. test against an in-progress `blockr.core` branch), edit `Remotes:` in `DESCRIPTION` instead:

```
Remotes:
    BristolMyersSquibb/blockr.core@my-feature-branch
```

## Secrets

- `BLOCKR_PAT` (optional) — GitHub PAT with access to private blockr repos. Falls back to `GITHUB_TOKEN` if not set, which is sufficient for public repos.
- `CODECOV_TOKEN` — for coverage uploads
